      Majestic cities, real-time battles, and a hundred years of Victorian history were meant to come to life in an ambitious grand-strategy game whose development is currently paused in favour of Triumph & Tragedy and AnalyticalEngine. With the majority of history and mapwork currently complete however, it is currently under consideration to either have its development resumed, or to be released as an open-source engine.
      <br><br>
      We support Project Alice in the meantime as an unaffiliated viable alternative covering the same timeframe.

      <b>'Civilisation in a Bot'.</b> A full desktop experience disguised as a Discord bot, Triumph & Tragedy I offers you the chance to found your very own nation and take it through the ages: expand sprawling urban settlements - experience the tumult of the Industrial Revolution - and stand by the sidelines or duke it out in massive world wars. How you lead your nation is up to you.
      <br><br>
      <b>From Research and Economies to Combat.</b> Through the Renaissance to the Digital Age, Triumph & Tragedy I is an all-encompassing game with everything from submarine warfare to the housing and infrastructure of your cities. Explore hundreds of technologies, units, and buildings, and unlock new mechanics to play with in an ever-changing world - all underneath a single Discord bot.
      <br><br>
      <b>Huge World Maps.</b> Armies, cities, goods, and colonists are no longer tied to numerical abstractions, but actual objects on a map that spans the globe and over 14.000 provinces. From the Siberian Wastes to the depths of the Amazon to fictional planets, each new map is guaranteed to bring with it new memories and scenarios.
      <br><br>
      <b>Modding Compatibility.</b> With an in-depth backend JSON-based modding API allowing for the customisation of buildings, units, governments, laws, events and technologies, building what may seem like an entirely new game is never more than a few lines of text away.

Used for everything from raster/research-level modelling to quick I/O tasks, Scriptly's main use-case is to serve as a stopgap for more complex programmes that may still be in the development pipeline.

      An ambitious sequel to the original game, T&T II simulates hundreds of millions of people on the individual-level from the bottom up to create complex economic chains and societal mechanics capable of driving entire nations. From world-spanning supply chains to the military logistics of a single company, to the biodiversity of a province and everything in between, Triumph & Tragedy II will be a game that holds no bars.
      <hr class = "parallax-item-content-panel-divider">
      <b>AI.</b> Treated as part of the core game, managing and creating your own AI bureaucrats in order to oversee mechanics for you in this vast simulation is absolutely essential to the continued survival of your nation-state. But watch out! You might not be the only one able to set mandates for your 'governors' and 'ministers' ..
      <br><br>
      <b>Creative Freedom.</b> Adjust the uniforms of your army to perfection, construct monuments that stand the test of time, or choose the staple crops of your people: Triumph & Tragedy II will offer unparalleled freedom in a sandbox-like environment. Choose what mechanics you want to play with, and leave the rest to your AI bureaucracy.
      <br><br>
      <b>Gamechanger.</b> From the Seven Years' War to the Rise of Rome, Triumph & Tragedy II will offer the ability to recreate historical, alt-history, and even entirely fictional scenarios without having to edit a single file. Create mos from the comfort of Discord with a built-in editor and preview your work in real time. We give the tools for you to create.
      <br><br>
      <b>Simulate Everything.</b> From the biodiversity of the Great Plains during the High Renaissance all the way to the highest echelons of government, it doesn't matter in Triumph & Tragedy II - everything is simulated at the most granular level possible to provide depth and engineer an experience unlike any other.
